1) Try to convert prototxt arch. into keras and retrain the model on the images of poses.
2) Search for predefined keras model for hand poses and retrain on the images of poses.
3) Make a hand pose model from scratch.(And ofcourse train on images of poses)

------------
Goal
------------
1) Make a csv dataset containing (X,Y,C) and save it respectively in their class folders.
2) Make an MLP classifier to classify C.
3) Check each image for inference.(If works properly, save the model)
4) Now make an end to end app for a smooth inference.
The img should pass through the HandPose model, then it extracts the KPs which shall pass through the MLP model, which shall finally yield the results.
